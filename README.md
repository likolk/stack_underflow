# Software Atelier 3 - The Web: Final Project


## What this repo contains:
This repository contains the project for Software Atelier 3 - The Web, a 3rd semester course of the Faculty of Informatics of Università della Svizzera Italiana, located in Lugano.


## What is Stack Underflow:
Stack Overflow is a web application that facilitates discussions regarding software development. Users have the chance to ask and at the same time, answer questions. Reciprocal sense is consequently a crucial element that separates people who use the program, enabling collaboration and knowledge-sharing.

The application may provide anyone a large collection of questions and answers, with the option for each individual to register or remain anonymous. Authenticated users can vote for the best answers and so promote those they find informative or useful.

The application interface is user friendly, providing a pleasant experience while browsing and ensuring the navigation to questions and answers is very simple.

The application is written using web programming languages;
In particular, the back-end is built using Node.js, Express.js and Socket.io frameworks. 

The front-end, is created using EJS views, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Our objective is to create a platform that allows anyone to share information through a big forum of questions and answers, and the ability to remain anonymous while browsing. The target audience of our application, includes, but is not limited to learners, software developers, students, and computer enthusiasts.

The application is hosted on Render, a cloud platform that facilitates the deployment of web apps.\
